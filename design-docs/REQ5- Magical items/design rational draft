Design rationale 

Player Class
This class represents players in the game. Player class extends Actor class. It is associated with the Vendor class to allow players to purchase magical items. Player class uses PickUpAction ( which extends the Action class) to pick up magical items, which are Super Mushroom and Power Star. 

PickUpAction class
This class extends the Action class to allow players to pick up Super Mushroom and Power Star

BuyAction class
This class extends the Action class to allow players to use coins to purchase magical items from the vendor

Vendor class
This class extends the Actor class and sells magical items to players. Vendor is associated with BuyAction as players can purchase magical items from the vendor. 

PowerStar class
This class is a subclass of items. Players that consume it will be healed by 200 hit points (hp) and become invincible. The invincible effect replaces fading duration (aka, fading turn's ticker stops), and it lasts for another 10 turns. It fades and disappears from the game within 10 turns. 

SuperMushroom class
This class is a subclass of items. Players  that consume Super Mushroom ^ will have max HP increased by 50, evolve to the uppercase letter (e.g., from m to M), and be able to jump freely with a 100% success rate and no fall damage. The effect will last until it receives any damage (e.g., hit by the enemy).

Coin class
This class is a subclass of  Items. It is currency the player uses to trade for magical  items. A coin has an integer value that determines the actual value of the money. Coins will spawn randomly from the Sapling (t). The collected coins can be traded with Toad (Vendor class)  for Wrench, Power Star and Super Mushroom.
